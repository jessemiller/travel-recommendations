# Japan
These recommendations are completely based on one trip there. I've also included some that were sent to me but I never got to. Hopefully they are still helpful, and we can continue to add to them. We spent a total of 6 nights in Tokyo, 2 in Kyoto, and one lost to travel+time change.
## Tokyo
Tokyo quickly became one of my favorite cities. Everything is clean and well designed, and the food is incredible. There was so much to do here, I felt like we barely scratched the surface.
### Getting around
The metro in Tokyo is incredible. It was pretty easy once we got used to the system. There are many lines, with certain stations to transfer. Lines are marked with different colors. Note that there is also the Japan Rail (JR) lines, which go around Tokyo locally as well. Certain stations with have entrances to both. If you have a JR Pass, you can ride the JR lines for free, but will sometimes need to transfer to a metro line to get closer to your destination. Google Maps was super useful, as it would suggest the lines and tell you specifically which platform in the station you can use. You buy tickets at machines, using cash, and pay based on how far you will go. Google Maps will tell you how much it will cost so I often used that rather than trying to find the stations on the map.

I found that, when looking up restaurants, it was best to first type them into Google through Chrome, make sure you have the right place, and then link into Google Maps from there. I directed us to the wrong place a couple of times by just trying to type a restaurant name into Google Maps and it taking us to something random.
### Eating
There was so much great food here. Like in other big cities, you can wander around certain areas and basically pick restaurants based on how busy they were. Trip Advisor is useful, but I did find that when we went to the top places on Trip Advisor, we'd end up a restaurant that was very easy to order at, but was only filled with other tourists. It was still good food, but something was lost. My favorite experiences were when we'd happen upon some random place, struggle to communicate what we'd like, and then have an amazing meal sitting next to locals. I'll list all the restaurants that I can remember here.
* Ichiran Shibuya - Ramen - [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E4%B8%80%E8%98%AD+%E6%B8%8B%E8%B0%B7%E3%82%B9%E3%83%9A%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E5%9D%82%E5%BA%97+Ichiran+Ramen/@35.6609511,139.6965346,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x60188ca9ab71057d:0x3cf8b41707c84c2b!8m2!3d35.6609511!4d139.6987233) - Good, spicy ramen, open really late. Interesting experience because of how you order and how they serve you. Perfect for after a night of drinking.
